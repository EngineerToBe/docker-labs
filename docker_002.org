* Docker Networking Model

The Docker networking architecture is built on a set of interfaces called the Container Networking Model (CNM).
The philosophy of CNM is to provide application portability across diverse infrastructures.
This model strikes a balance to achieve application portability and also takes advantage of special features and capabilities of the infrastructure.
