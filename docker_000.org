Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.

Containerization is increasingly popular because containers are:

  - Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
  - Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
  - Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
  - Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
  - Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
  - Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.


* Who all can use Docker?

Docker can be use by Sys Admins, QA, Developers and DevOps. Running application inside docker helps and make
application platform independent.

* How Docker differs from Virtual Machines?

A container runs on Operating System without any layer, and share the kernel with the host Operating System.
