Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.

Containerization is increasingly popular because containers are:

  - Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
  - Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
  - Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
  - Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
  - Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
  - Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.
