* What is Docker?

Docker was created by Solomon Hykes (Original Author), now it is developed and maintained by Docker INC.
Docker is a tool to make application build, ship and deploy irrespective of any Operating System or any
environment.

Docker runs on all 3 major Operating System

  - Linux
  - MacOS
  - Microsoft Windows

* What is a Container?

Container can be considered as a standard unit of software. A container major components are Namespaces and Cgroups.
Namespaces and Cgroups both are Kernel features.

***** Namespaces
      We can create namespaces with command unshare. Namespaces provides isolation for the process.

      - Process ID
      - Mount
      - IPC (Inter process communication)
      - User (currently experimental support for)
      - Network

***** Cgroups
      Cgroups provide resource limitation and reporting capability within the container space.They allow granular control over what host resources are allocated to the containers and when they are allocated.


      - CPU
      - Memory
      - Network Bandwidth
      - Disk
      - Priority

Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.

Containerization is increasingly popular because containers are:

  - Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
  - Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
  - Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
  - Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
  - Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
  - Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.


* Who all can use Docker?

Docker can be use by Sys Admins, QA, Developers and DevOps. Running application inside docker helps and make
application platform independent.

* How Docker differs from Virtual Machines?

A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers. It runs a discrete process, taking no more memory than any other executable, making it lightweight.

By contrast, a virtual machine (VM) runs a full-blown “guest” operating system with virtual access to host resources through a hypervisor. In general, VMs provide an environment with more resources than most applications need.
