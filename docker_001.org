* Create our first Docker Image!

Docker images are further categorized in 2 types

  - Base Image

    If we need to have more control on whats going in my images we should use base image, which means
    we need to create a Docker image from scratch.

  - Parent Image

    Parent image is something we will be using image created by someone else and build our image on top
    of this image.

Lets create our first Docker Base Image

#+BEGIN_SRC
sudo debootstrap stretch stretch > /dev/null
sudo tar -C stretch -c . | docker import - stretch
#+END_SRC

Lets create our first Docker Parent Image

#+BEGIN_SRC
FROM scratch
ADD hello /
CMD ["/hello"]
#+END_SRC
